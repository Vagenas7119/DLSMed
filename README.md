## Abstract:
The ocean is dynamically changing due to the influence of climate processes and human activities. The construction of the Suez Canal in the late 19th century opened the Pandoraâ€™s box by facilitating the dispersal of Red Sea species in the Mediterranean Sea. Nowadays, the phenomenon of marine invasions is progressing and seriously threatens marine ecosystems. Herein, we analyzed detection records of the non-indigenous fishes that entered through the Suez Canal, to disentangle their dynamic spread through space and time. We identified a north-westward trajectory with an average expansion time step of 2.5 years and we estimated the overall time for a non-indigenous species to reach the Central Mediterranean from the Suez Canal at approximately 22 years. We discovered that more than half of the introduced fishes have been established in 10 years. The findings presented herein may contribute to management initiatives concerning biological invasions in this highly invaded region.
