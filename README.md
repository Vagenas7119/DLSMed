Decoding the spread of non-indigenous fishes in the Mediterranean Sea

## Abstract:
The ocean is dynamically changing due to the influence of climate processes and human activities. Among these alterations, the construction of the Suez Canal in the late 19th century opened the Pandoraâ€™s box by facilitating the unintentional dispersal of hundreds of Red Sea species in the Mediterranean Sea. Nowadays, the phenomenon of marine biological invasions is progressing and seriously threatens the status of native species, habitats and marine ecosystem services. Herein, we comprehensively analyzed consecutive observation data of all the non-indigenous fishes of the Mediterranean Sea that entered through the Suez Canal, to disentangle their dynamic spread through space and time. We identified a north-westward trajectory with an average expansion time step of 2.5 years, while we estimated the overall required time for a non-indigenous species to reach the Central Mediterranean from the Suez Canal at approximately 22 years. More than half of the introduced non-indigenous fishes have been established, while the time for establishment is approximately 10 years. Furthermore, we discovered that the expansion time step is accelerating by 50% after the initial entrance in the Mediterranean Sea. We strengthened the produced generalized patterns through the validation of species-specific spatial and temporal movement activity. Finally, we highlighted certain limitations and discussed future applications that can arise through the momentum approach towards advanced management strategies in the field of marine biological invasions.
